## Bridgekeeper is a request throttler for http.Client

Bridgekeeper replaces the hard implementation of `http.Client` with an
implementation of a shared interface such that anything implementing the
`bridgekeeper.Client` interface can use Bridgekeeper to throttle API requests through configuration.

### Using Bridgekeeper

```go
go get -u devnw.com/bridgekeeper@latest
```

### Example

```go
    client := New(
        ctx, // Your application context
        http.DefaultClient, // Your HTTP Client
        time.Millisecond, // Delay between requests
        5, // Retry count
        10, // Concurrent request limit
        http.DefaultClient.Timeout, // Request timeout
    )

    resp, err := client.Do(http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "localhost:5555"))
```

## Client Interface

Bridgekeeper implements the interface shown below

```go
type Client interface {
    Do(request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error)
}
```

This interface is also implemented by `http.Client`.
